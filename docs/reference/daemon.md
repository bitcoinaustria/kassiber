# Daemon Reference

Kassiber's desktop shell talks to the Python core through a local JSONL
daemon. The daemon is started by the Tauri supervisor, reads one JSON object
per line from stdin, and writes one JSON envelope per line to stdout.

Start it directly for development:

```bash
python -m kassiber --data-root /tmp/kassiber-demo/data daemon
```

The daemon bootstraps the normal Kassiber runtime: it creates the state
layout if needed, opens the SQLite database, and serves status from that
local store.

The Tauri supervisor starts the same command. In development it prefers the
repo-local `.venv/bin/python`, then `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows,
then `python3`. Set `KASSIBER_DAEMON_PYTHON=/path/to/python` to override
the Python executable, or `KASSIBER_REPO_ROOT=/path/to/checkout` when the
development binary should run against a different checkout.

Packaged prerelease desktop builds bundle a one-file PyInstaller CLI sidecar
and prefer that bundled executable before the development Python fallback when
starting the daemon. `KASSIBER_DAEMON_PYTHON` remains the highest-priority
override for debugging.

The first line is always a lifecycle envelope:

```json
{"kind":"daemon.ready","schema_version":1,"data":{"version":"0.21.0","supported_kinds":["status","daemon.shutdown"]}}
```

Requests carry a caller-chosen `request_id`, a `kind`, and optional `args`:

```json
{"request_id":"status-1","kind":"status"}
```

Responses use the normal machine envelope plus the same `request_id`.
`schema_version` follows the CLI machine-output contract; bump it only when
consumers must change how they parse daemon envelopes.

```json
{"kind":"status","schema_version":1,"data":{},"request_id":"status-1"}
```

Errors use the standard error envelope shape and also echo `request_id` when
the request supplied one. Malformed JSON and non-object requests cannot carry
a caller request id, so they return `request_id: null`. `daemon.shutdown`
asks the daemon to write a final shutdown envelope and exit cleanly.

Only `status` is backed by real data in the first slice, and its `data`
payload mirrors `kassiber --machine status`. UI snapshot kinds return
`daemon_unavailable` until typed contracts and read models land.
